## News ##
  * ## 10/30/2016 tweaks and 64-bit on Windows changes ##
  * ## updating project after move to github ##
    * google code was shutting down. moved the project to github, but hadn't really updated it much.

## **Installing** the plugin. ##

  * Download an .xpl file for your platform.

  * Check for, and delete any old copies of the plugin, before copying the new one into place.
    * _The file names in the download section will change between versions._
    * _Having two or more version of the plugin running will have unpredictable results._
    
  * Place the _.xpl_ file in `<x-plane install directory>/Resources/plugins` directory.

That's it.

## Using the plugin ##

The base plugin setup (no landmarks data file) will use the built in x-plane database to render airports, navaids and fixes without any additional setup.

You simply download the 'xpl' as noted above, put it in the plugins directory, start X-Plane and start using the plugin.

The plugin is configured via the "plugins" menu in X-Plane, so when you first start X-Plane, you may not see any 3D output from the plugin, unless you've selected rendering options from the XSA-NG configuration menu.

The plugin can take a few seconds to start showing points, as it slowly warms up, to keep performance impact low.

If you change areas through the X-Plane menus, it again may take the plugin a few seconds to load the points in the area you've just moved to.

That's it.

I've enjoyed making the plugin, and I find that having it really enhances my enjoyment of VFR flying, especially with "heavies", since the plugin gives me many more options for having visual "landmarks" to be able to use, when dead reckoning, or lining up approaches.

Enjoy.
